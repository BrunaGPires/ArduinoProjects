# Arduino
Repository made to store all my projects, experiments, and code related to Arduino.

## About
This repository was created to store and share the projects I am developing using the Arduino platform. Here you'll find a variety of projects, from simple LED blinking to more complex projects involving sensors, motors, and wireless communication.

Some of the projects were made in Wokwi, Tinkercad, and IRL using Arduino components
